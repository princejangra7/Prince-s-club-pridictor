In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the General Terms and these Commercial Terms, the provisions of the Commercial Terms shall take precedence with respect to any commercial activities conducted on the Site. Any capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Terms.

Submit Tool
By submitting an AI tool (the "Tool") for consideration, the Customer represents and warrants that they have the legal right to submit the Tool and that all information provided in connection with the submission is accurate, complete, and not misleading.
The Site will conduct a thorough review of all submitted Tools to determine their compatibility with its database criteria. The acceptance of a Tool is at the sole discretion of the Site, which reserves the right to accept or reject any submission without obligation or explanation. The Site will notify the Customer of the outcome of the submission review within a reasonable time frame.

Get Featured
Promotion Mechanism
The Site offers its users the “Get Featured” function, as a method through which their already listed Tool can be promoted for a fee, by "buying clicks".
The actual promotion consists in increasing the traffic to the Tool published by its creator by placing the Tool in the "Featured Ads" section of the Site, which guarantees a higher number of clicks for the Tool. The number of clicks depends exclusively on the amount invested in this feature.

How it works
Get Featured consists of the following steps:
You search for your tool in the “Search for your tool” function;
You choose the amount (expressed in USD) that you want to invest for each click; this amount is called “Bid”; the permitted Bid is between 0.20$ - 100$ per click; you can change your Bid in real time from your Dashboard function;
You choose the number of clicks you want to buy with the amount selected at the previous step; the number of clicks allowed is between 1.000 and 50.000; DON’T FORGET! A higher bid means more clicks per day!
You pay the total amount resulting from the options you have chosen; for more details on how the payment of the Commercial Services offered by the Site operates, please consult the Section 4 (Fees) of these Commercial Terms;
Your Tool will be included within the list of the Featured Ads section of the Site immediately; the position is determined by your Bid: the higher your Bid, the higher your Tool will be on the list.
Other things you should know
Get Featured is available and can be accessed even by users who are not logged in. Clicks are counted when users visit your Tool’s external link found in the Featured Ads section of our Site. Duplicate clicks within the same day will not be taken into account.
Custom Campaign
The Site provides a service referred to as "Custom Campaigns." This service enables Customers to create marketing campaigns that are specifically designed to align with the distinct features and objectives of their Tools.

Campaign Design
Each Custom Campaign will be formulated based on the specific requirements and goals articulated by the Customer. The Site will assess the Customer's needs to ensure the campaign is appropriately structured for optimal effectiveness.
If you choose to contract a Custom Campaign, you will be redirected to a Contact form in which you will have to send us an inquiry. Shortly after that you will be contacted by our team to establish all the needed details (including payment) for your Tool to be promoted on our Site.
Implementation
The Site will oversee the execution of the Custom Campaign, employing industry-standard practices to facilitate user engagement and conversion.
Effectiveness
The Customer acknowledges that the success of any Custom Campaign is subject to various influencing factors, including market conditions and audience behavior. The Site does not guarantee specific outcomes or results from the implementation of Custom Campaigns.
Responsibilities
The Customer agrees to provide all necessary information and resources required for the effective development and execution of the Custom Campaign. The Site shall not be held liable for any deficiencies in campaign performance attributable to any delayed, incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the Customer.
Sponsorship
Sponsorship Opportunities
The Site offers its users the “Sponsorship” function, as a method through which their already listed Tool can be promoted on different online platforms including the Site’s platform, the Site’s Newsletter, LinkedIn and X/Twitter.
The more unique channels are purchased by the Customer for its Tool, the more exposure it buys, and the more likely the Tool is to be seen and accessed by the various types of visitors who access any of the proposed channels.
Website
The main way in which your Tool can be promoted is through our own platform on the Site.
The Site offers a prime advertising opportunity for either 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks or 4 weeks, during the time which your Tool will receive the visibility on our platform. This Sponsorship package includes a dedicated space directly beneath our logo, where you can place a clickable link to your website, along with a short tagline of up to five words.

Package 1. Main website sponsorship – 3 days: Sponsorship program running for 3 full calendar days from the moment you pay for it;

None of the Commercial Services offered by the Site guarantees the success of the product or brand created by a Customer and promoted through the Commercial Services offered by the Site.
Any number of clicks/visitors/impressions that the Site offers through one of its promotional mechanisms does not completely guarantee the achievement of such number of clicks/visitors/impressions, but represents an average frequency of clicks/visitors/impressions that the Site has observed in its engagement stream from the time of the launch of the promotional methods to date.
The Site reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Commercial Service (or any part thereof) at any time without notice.

Indemnification
The Customer agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Site, including its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, successors, and assigns (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, demands, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, court costs, and any settlement amounts) (collectively, “Claims”) arising from or related to any of the following:
Use of Services: Any use of the Commercial Services by the Customer that violates these Commercial Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy, or any applicable laws or regulations;
Breach of Commercial Terms: Any actual or alleged breach of these Commercial Terms by the Customer or any negligence or willful misconduct of the Customer;
Third-Party Claims: Any Claims brought by a third party arising from or related to the Customer’s use of the Commercial Services, including claims of infringement of any intellectual property rights or privacy rights.
